                That is an excellent question I ask myself every day. <br><br>

                <!-- My job/experience/skillset -->
                I'm a front end engineer at Microsoft. My everyday job is to create intutive, rich and performant web user experience for Azure Portal.
                I enjoy learning and discussing about design so that we can guide our customers in the most effective way and achieve our business goals.
                <br><br>

                When I'm off work, I enjoy interactive art installations and creating visual candies.

                If you want to be more creative than just saying 'Hi', write a sentence including your favorite flavor in the email title.

                I am ever growing human being. I love making beautiful things and chasing after eye candies.

                    Create art so <i>f*cking</i> beautiful it will make you cry
                </div>
                <br>
                Art has shown me my life purpose, it has healed my heart and brought joy. I want to bring that experience to others and do good to our community.

                I love making new connections.
                If you wanna be more creative than putting "Hi" in subject line, write a sentence including your favorite color.
                For example, my favorite color is red. So my title would be "Let's meet when the moon turns <i>shy</i> red."
