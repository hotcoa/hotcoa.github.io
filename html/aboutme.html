                My goal is to create an art that will make you cry because it's that beautiful and touches your heart like no other has done before.
                
                You can always contact me at hotcoa@gmail.com. If you do, I have one small ask for you.
                In the subject line, write a sentence including your favorite color. 
                For example, my favorite color is red. So my title would be something like "Let's meet when the moon turns shyly into red." I know, so romantic right? ;)
